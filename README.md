# meals-app
The application from React-Native course

Was tested on Android only, so I am not sure it is gonna be working on IOS. 
To start the application you need to go to its folder with your Command Line and then execute command
#npm start
or 
#expo start
Then you will see the new window in your browser with UI for Expo. There you will be able to find QR-code at the bottom of the screen.
Scan this one with the Expo app installed on your smartphone and wait 'till Expo finishes downloading the bundle.
